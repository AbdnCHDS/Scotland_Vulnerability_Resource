### The goal here is to play around with Rshiny and to make it easier to join the Small Area Population Estimates to the Scotland Vulnernability Resource


#### Loading needed Libraries

## The whole Idea of this is. That someone with little knowledge of R, can just run the App without having to install the packages needed

if(!require("tidyverse")){ # Checking if the Libraries are already installed. If TRUE it will run the package
  install.packages("tidyverse")# If FALSE, install them
  library("tidyverse") # run them
}


if(!require("shiny")){ # Checking if the Libraries are already installed. If TRUE it will run the package
  install.packages("shiny")# If FALSE, install them
  library("shiny") # run them
}

if(!require("here")){ # Checking if the Libraries are already installed. If TRUE it will run the package
  install.packages("here")# If FALSE, install them
  library("here") # run them
}


##### Loading the data

# First we load the Scotland Vulnerability resource
df_SVR <- read.csv(here("SVR-data","Scotland-Vulnerability-Resource_v0.2.csv"))
# Second we load the Small Area Poputlation Estimate from 2019
df_SAPE2019.Female <-
