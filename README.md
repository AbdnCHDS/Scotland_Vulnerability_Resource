# Grampian Vulnerability Resource

## Aim

To create a single resource with demographic, socioeconomic, and deprivation measures for Grampian.

This will allow us to identify vulnerable people using a broader definition than healthcare use.

It will also allow us to measure if a given group is different from the region as a whole.



## Example reports that require this data

All men over 70 who live in high-density areas and have more than one chronic disease

All people on the COVID shielding list who live in places with long drive-time to a retail centre

Differences between people who are vulnerable due to respiratory disease in Aberdeen City vs rural Aberdeenshire
