# Scotland Vulnerability Resource (SVR)

## Description

The Scotland Vulnerability Resource (SVR) a ready-to-use resource that unifies demographic, socioeconomic, and deprivation measures for Scotland in a single data set. This will allow and enable users to broaden definition “vulnerable people” beyond the scope of its healthcare base definition. SVR allows you to swiftly identify “vulnerable people” and the difference of any given group to the region as a whole.
